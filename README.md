Project Miracle
===============

Project Miracle is my personal technology project designed to answer the age-old question: _Who wrote that song?_

My technology blog [Fun In Space](http://fun-in-space.com) has more information and was created in part to track the progress building this project.

The idea is to combine various techniques in data analysis, machine learning, audio research and other mechanisms to learn as much as we can about the musical offerings of [Queen](http://www.queenonline.com), the greatest band of the last 40 years.
